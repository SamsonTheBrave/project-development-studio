		<ul> questions for the semester:
			<li>What makes objects enchanged?</li>
			<li>What makes technologies transparent?</li>
			<li>What helps us escape from the terminal world?</li>
			<li>How do we cure the cellphone zombie apocolypes?</li>
			<li>How do stigmatised technologies like glasses or hearing aids become main stream?</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
	Goal: To make a series of simple objects which bring delight to users and provide usable information at a glance or a touch.

	Project Descriptions: 
	<ol>
		<li>Umbrella Deviner: One of the questions I have day in and day out is about the weather. Is it going to rain today? My desire is to findout what can be learned from a smart umbrella which simply displays a single bit of information of todays events. Simply "yes" or "no", but in the form of colors. Blue for rain, yellow for sun. Using bluetooth and a custom made weather api I want to provide the umbrellas weilder with information through the lights only when it is needed.

		added features might be:
			<li>google now integration to try and target key times during the day when people will need an umbrella.</li>
			<li>location geofensing to determine when the umbrella may have been left unintentionally.</li>
		</li>
		<li>Hearphones: what happens when the stigma of hearing aids is removed and everyone wants enhanced hearing? Not just those people who are impaired? What happens when we bridge the gap between hearing aids and headphones?
