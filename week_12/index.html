<h1>What Can A Picture Tell Us?</h1>

		What can this image tell us about the progress of our pursuits? Well in the image one might see the research process. A series of browser tabs open in a window. Some of these tabs are relevant to the question at hand, "How do we make bookmarks useful?". In the first tab there is what might be described as a diamond, it serves an imperfect consolidation device, which hides all of your musings into <b>one</b> tab. It is imperfect because I never use it for its intended purpose. The next 4 tabs have to do with Mongoose Databases, particularly how to make subdocuments or in other words a nested file structure inside of a database. I haven't used those tabs in 2 weeks. The next 2 tabs are github pages which are entirely unrelated to Trailz-with-a-z, aside from the fact that we a posting our code to github, but that's only tangentially related. The remaining 7 tabs are project relevant, but largely because they illuminate the development process. 

		Upload Chrome extension, in <a href="chrome://extensions/">chrome://extensions/</a> --> go to the page you want to try it on, in our case an empty browser tab --> reload the page to make sure that the extension set --> click on the "Display Trailz" button injected onto the page by our extension --> watch the magic. Oh boy is there magic! 

		This brings us to the final tab. A moment of triumph, because it represents weeks of trying to integrate a database, a chrome extension, and a pursuit of making browsing the web a better experience.

		But, returning our attention to the original image, the fact is it didn't really tell us anything except the quality of our extension thus far, that is to say jumbled. That is to say I told you, but thats ok because without the picture my words would mean much less. The picture however is also a lie because we have made significant process since then.

		Here we have blank page which has a customized heading and menu bar programmatically injected into it from the Chrome extension. The file path which is where the URL normally lives is a mashup of personal organization and affection. The latter being there largely because Cole has referred to me as Sammy --> /Project%20Development/Trailz/Sammy/ the other folders in the system path indicate categorical organization going from broad to specific. 

		This second (third) image shows the content of our server being added to the page after the "Display Trailz" button is pressed.

		This is where I need to make a <h2 class="inline">Project Update</h2> or if we're still talking about <h2 class="inline">Trailz with a z</h2>, a fork in the path. Cole, and I have a tendency to talk a lot. This is great because we are constantly refining, remixing and retelling our ideas. That said, our tendency towards talking means that it's only now (admittedly late in the game) that I have an update for the trail summit. 

		Instead of focusing on where we've been, Trailz, is now focusing on where we are. "Very <i>mindful</i> of you." Thanks. We know. We arrived here because of a few things, but primarily because we realized that the way we were intending to visualize the "trailz" were in the form of a branching tree structure, which seems great initially, but when it comes down to it, it seemed like too rigid a form. Forcing user data to conform to a tree structure is both difficult and likely to result in bad user interaction. Specifically, it would likely require them to manage their own branches and paths. Gross! By focusing on the present we do not have to worry to much about how to display a users history, we just have to worry about serving up relevant bookmarked content to the site they are on. Fortunately, this doesn't derail our efforts thus far. 

		We can still use much of the framework for the database that we have created and the chrome extension. The biggest casualty of this is the metaphor of a trail, doesn't make the most sense because we are now focusing more on content and context of the current page.

		I think we're close to the end for our friend at the end of the alphabet.
