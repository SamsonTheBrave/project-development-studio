		This week I have been grappling whether or not to even take Project Deveolpment Studio. The main two questions I have are: is there a class which would be more influential to me in my last full semester at ITP and is there a way for me to get a jump on thesis which would be more beneficial? Furthermore, what ideas do I have which lend themselves to 14 weeks of work without inherent direction? I have my past projects, Haptec bike at <a href="http://www.haptec.io">haptec.io</a>, which was an early exploration into what bike navigation could be. After that there was WHEARS which was a wearable device which was meant to help enhance the wearers sense of direction without replacing their mental map and explore ways to be reminded of a place of importance. What do these projects have in common? A lot: navigation, the simplification of technology, the focus on enhancement as appose to deminishment of our senses, freedom from screens, and the underlying technology they do employ. 

		Where is the anwser to my questions? In a book by David Rose called Enchanted Objects. It's about taking everyday object and embuing them with tech to do unexpected things but delightful things. An umbrella which tells you when it's going to rain or a wallet which keeps track of your expenses. It's also a perfect place for me to explore the needless creation of objects which are useless to us reminiscent of the home automation era when just about every item in the kitchen had a plug and motor installed into it. Now we can have forks which tell you when you've eaten to much and dishwashers which send you text message when the dishes are done. You might be asking why do I want to make technology that is so useless. My point really is I don't, but I think I can make a difference by getting there first.
