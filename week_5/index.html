			<h1>Update</h1>
		
			<p class="text-body">
				Since the 4th class I have been working to solidify my ideas for project development studio. The biggest change has come in the form of working with Cole Orloff. We have decided to work on a project to reshape the way in which we store and find useful information online. While I have not given up my dreams of making Enchanted Objects for Project Development Studio, I have taken a bit of a detour. OK let me get to the challenge and then I'll get back to the whole enchanted objects thing.

				<h3>The Challenge of The Internet:</h3> Currently, we see the issue with the browsing experience as on in which information just sifts through our minds. In "The Shallows" by Nicholas Carr, he points out that our brains have been forever altered by the Internet. He points to the change in reading style as the primary cause. The jump from linear book reading which promoted focus and attention skills to the fragmented plucking of information in the way in which we use the Internet. Often I am found looking for information for hours if not days, with my only real resource as Google. The tools at my disposal for retaining this information are some combination of search history, bookmarks, persistent browser tabs, re-searches and an ill conceived note taking system (if I can call it that). Each of these in turn has their own shortcomings. First search history currently is in the form of linear links time line, which literally provides every link I have gone to. After a normal days use (or hour) pertinent links are buried deep beneath others, ultimately making search history really only usable for those tab(links) with were recently closed. Second, bookmarks only provide a simple (superficial) way of recording a place of interest because usually they are buried in folders on the browser bar. Rarely do they see the light of day again. If they do its is because it is for a site which is not easily searchable, like say a class site. But the challenge is not really the site which we visit frequently, it is the sites which we have been to before yet cannot remember what we learned there and therefore I must relearn the same information. To be fair this relearning is a part of the learning process (and an important one). However, I want to make re-finding pertinent information easier. Tabs, remain the bane of my online existence and particularly when I am trying to find information. I am constantly opening more tabs than I close. It is painfully obvious to me that this paradigm needs to be changed because of the days when Chrome crashes and I loose my open tabs, which leaves me simultaneously saddened and relieved that I finally have a clean slate (if only for the next half hour). The next form of information gathering is a combination of Evernote and my note book. This is where I start to jot down my ideas down, but usually that is where they stay unless I make the effort to transpose them and synthesize them.

			<h3>The Idea:</h3>
			 Use technology! create a system which allows users to easily document where they have been online and create a network of usable, timely, and shareable information. A list of possible idea tag lines:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Visual History</li>
			 	<li>Memory Aid</li>
			 	<li>Learning Search</li>
			 	<li>Learning Path</li>
			 	<li>Learning Segment: Use the idea of Stava to compare users paths with other peoples processes for learning the same information and then offer users with real time feedback of potential other options</li>
			 	<li>Dynamic Bibliography</li>
			 </ul>
			</p>

				<h3>Research:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.xanadu.com/"> Project Xanadu</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://genius.com/"> Genius: Annotate the Web. This actually seems to be pretty promising in terms of what we're looking for. Just on first brush I have some issues with annotation methods. It's like there is a comments section on every page of the Internet, but they still feel trapped and poorly organized</a>
