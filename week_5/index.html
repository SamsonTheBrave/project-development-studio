				Since the 4th class I have been working to solidify my ideas for project development studio. The biggest change has come in the form of working with Cole Orloff. We have decided to work on a project to reshape the way in which we store and find usualful information online. While I have not given up my dreams of making Enchanted Objects for Project Development Studio, I have taken a bit of a detour. OK let me get to the challenge and then I'll get back to the whole enchanted objects thing.

				<h3>The Challenge of The Internet:</h3> Currently, we see the issue with the bowsering expereince as on in which information just sifts through our minds. often we are found looking for information for hours if not days, with our only real resource as Google. The tools at our disposal for retaining this information are some combination of search history, bookmarks, persistant browser tabs and re-seaches. Each of these inturn has their own shortcommings. First search history currently is in the form of linear links time line, which literially provides every link you have gone to. After a normal days use (or hour) pertinant links are burried deep beneath others, ultimately making seach history really only usable for those tab(links) with were recently closed. Second, bookmarks only provide a simple (superficial) way of recording a place of interest because the usually are burried in folders on the browser bar. Rarely do they see the light of day again. If they do its is because it is for a site which which is not easily seachable, like say a class site. But the challenge is not really the site which we visit frequently, it is the sites which we have been to before yet cannot remember what we learned there and therefore must relearn the same information. To be fair this is relearn is a part of the learning process however I think this needs to be a simplified process.
